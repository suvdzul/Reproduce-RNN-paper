# Reproduction template

The goal of this template is to guide documentation of a reproduction of a study in an electronic health record database. Reproductions are assumed to be retrospective observational studies.

This template is based on material from the OSF, as well as from Brandt et al., 2013.

## Data extraction

### Inclusion/Exclusion criteria

Provide the column names for your proposed "cohort" table, which will apply all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Include the description of the criteria, the table in the dataset you will use, and how missing data will be interpreted (e.g. missing values will be assumed to include the patient).

First create an admission list for admissions in the ICU between 2008 and 2012, excluding non-first admissions and create "admission id" column. Next, get item id list from inputevents, outputevents, labevents, and prescription tables. For each item id in the table, get number of units of each itemid and choose the major unit as the target of unit conversion and discard the observations with minority unit of measurement if the top one has more than 90% of the total, otherwise convert. For each of the ICU admission records, collect both the variable value and the time-stamp of observation. Records for the first 48 hours after admission are included only, thus exclude_timediff_above48 column will be added which indicates whether the observation is after the first 48 hours:
* Inputevents: admittime - starttime > 48, discard events without starttime or amount/amountuom
* Outputevents: admittime - charttime > 48, discard events without charttime or value/valueuom
* Labevents: admittime - charttime > 48, discard events without charttime or value/valueuom/valuenum
* Prescriptions: admittime - starttime > 48, discard events without starttime or amount/amountuom, discard none values

For non-temporal outcome variables, get each patient's ICD-9 Codes for the admission and their mortality labels. 

For mortality, 3 columns:
* in-hospital mortality: deathtime is not null
* 48 < mortality: deathtime - admittime > 48 hrs if deathtime not null
* Patients who were alive for the first 48 hours after admission are included, thus exclude_mortality_under48 column will be added which would be an indicator variable for deathtime - admittime <= 48. 

Group the ICD-9 Codes as the Table 2 in Section 3.4 of the Supplementary Information and create columns for each of the 20 categories, indicating whether the patient had the diagnoses or the procedures during their stay in the ICU.

### Variables

List out the planned source for all covariates and exposures extracted for the study, e.g. admission source.
If describing a time-varying covariate, be specific regarding the aggregation and the time window (e.g. "lowest mean arterial pressure during the first 24 hours of the ICU stay."). The following template is a useful guide.

For all the variables listed below, the value and the timestamp will be extracted for each admission id recorded for the first 48 hours after first ICU admission.

### Outcome(s)

List the outcome(s) used in the study, e.g. 28-day mortality, with similar detail as the above variables.

Variable name | Description | Timing | Aggregation | Source | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
ICD Code | Codes for diagnoses/procedures during a stay | Anytime during the first 48 hours after admission | Group them accordingly into 20 categories | diagnoses_icd and procedures_icd | Create binary variables for each category indicating whether the patient was diagnosed or had a procedure for that certain category
in-hospital mortality | Whether the patient died in the hospital | Anytime during the hospital stay for that admission | Deathtime not null indicates mortality | admissions | 
48 hr < mortality |Whether the patient died 48 hours after admission | Anytime during their stay but 48 hours after admission | deathtime - admittime > 48 or not if deathtime not null| admissions |
